# Pypher Changelog

### 0.20.1 -- 08/27/2022

* Fixed -- an issue with hops/property ordering. See -- https://github.com/emehrkay/Pypher/pull/53


### 0.20.0 -- 03/19/2022

* Added -- the ability to define custom quotes for labels, properties, and map_keys 

```
import pyper
pyper.builder.QUOTES['propery'] = '"' # this will quote properties with a " instead of `
```

### 0.19.0 -- 1/21/2022

* Fixed -- removed an unused `hashable` import to make Pypher python 3.10 compatable. Thanks Peter BÃ¡bics (@pbabics)

### 0.18.1 -- 7/31/2020

* Fixed -- no longer binding python values of `True` and `False`, they will return `true` and `false` in the resulting cypher.


### 0.18.0 -- 7/8/2020

* Added `max` as a predefined function
* Added `create_statement` and `create_function` to the tester
* Added a new param called `hops` for specifying a single hop number.`min_hops` and `max_hops` are reserved for specifying variable length relationships. If hops is specified, and one (or both) of min_hops and max_hops is specified, an error is raised. If just one of min_hops or max_hops is specified, then the range is only bounded on that side.


### 0.17.2 -- 11/26/2019

#### BugFix

* Fixed an issue with the interactive tester where defining a custom `Func` or `Statement` inline would throw an `already registered` error


### 0.17.1 -- 11/26/2019

#### BugFix

* Fixed an error where custom `Func` or `Statement` sub-classed classes were not properly referenced when building out the final Pypher object.


### 0.17.0 -- 10/08/2019

#### Added

* Bitwise operators that compile down to apoc calls
    * `BAND`
    * `BOR`
    * `BXOR`
    * `BNOT`
    * `BLSHIFT`
    * `BRSHIFT`
    * `BULSHIFT`


### 0.16.4 -- 6/24/2019

#### Bugfix

* Fixed an issue where calling `.re()` for regular expresson matching, will bind its passed in params.


### 0.16.3 -- 6/22/2019

#### Bugfix

* Fixed an issue where calling `.append()` on an empty Pypher instance did not work as expected.

### 0.16.2 -- 2/21/2019

#### Bugfix

* Fixed the output from doing a not equal comparison between Pypher objects. It used to result to `!=` which is invalid Cypher, now it results in `<>`

```python
p = Pypher()
p2 = Pypher()

p.a != p2.b

str(p) # a != b

# after 0.16.2
str(p) # a <> b
```


### 0.16.1 -- 2/13/2019

#### Bugfix

* Setting `None` as values did not result in the keyword `NULL`, but a string of `'null'`.

### 0.16.0 -- 2/11/2019

#### Added

* Support for allowing `Pypher` instances as values in `Param` instances.

```python
p = Pypher()
val = 'some value'
name = 'name'
p.MATCH.node('p', 'person', lastname=__.coalesce(name, val))

str(p) # MATCH (p:`person` {`lastname`: coalesce($NEO_06c97_0, $NEO_06c97_1)})
```


### 0.15.0 -- 1/26/2019

#### Added

* `Pypher.link()` method that will shortcut the process of adding a dynamically named object to the Pypher instance.

```python
p = Pypher()
x = 'mark'

# the old ways
getattr(p, x).__location__ == 'MD'

#or
p.add_link(Statement(x)).__location__ == 'MD'

# with .link
p.link(x).__location__ == 'MD'
```

### 0.14.5 -- 11/18/2018

### 0.14.4 -- 11/8/2018

### Bugfix

* Fixed a bug where assignment operators were not allowing nested dicts in lists.

## 0.14.3 -- 10/19/2018

### Bugfix

## 0.13.0 -- 8/26/2018

### Added

* `Conditional`, `ConditionalAND`, and `ConditionalOR` objects that will produce lists with parenthesis with a separator.
